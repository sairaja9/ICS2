Welcome to the Oregon Trail! Your goal is to travel by wagon
train from New York City to Oregon (2000 miles). You start on
March 1st, and your goal is to reach Oregon by December 31st.
The trail is arduous. Each day costs you food and health. You
can hunt and rest, but you have to get there before winter!
"""

help_text = """
Each turn you can take one of 3 actions:

  travel - moves you randomly between 30-60 miles and takes
           3-7 days (random).
  rest   - increases health 1 level (up to 5 maximum) and takes
           2-5 days (random).
  hunt   - adds 100 lbs of food and takes 2-5 days (random).

When prompted for an action, you can also enter one of these
commands without using up your turn:

  status - lists food, health, distance traveled, and day.
  help   - lists all the commands.
  quit   - will end the game.
  
You can also use these shortcuts for commands:

  't', 'r', 'h', 's', '?', 'q'
