    if n == 1:   #Starting value for Fibonacci Sequence
        return 1

    if n == 2:  #Second value in Fibonacci Sequence
        return 1

#The first two values in the Fibonacci Sequence are 1 and 1.

    return fibonacci_sequence(n-1) + fibonacci_sequence(n-2)

#This command builds on the new infinite values after 1 and 1 (the starting two values).

for i in range(1, 15):
    print(fibonacci_sequence(i))

# This for loop specifies the number of iterations python will complete.  
# In other words, If you want the 15th number in the Fibonacci Sequence:
# make the maximum range 15 python will run the program and give you the 15th iteration or loop.
