########## Introduction ##########
intro_text = '''
The quick fun associated with a guessing game can help you kill time in a car ride, a long line, or any of the million boring situations.  Run this program with your friends and family whenever you feel the need to have some fun.  Think of a famous person right now.  The program will ask you questions like: how old is your character, is he an athlete? etc.  The program will continue to ask you questions until it chooses a character.  See if you can outthink the program.  If you want more of a challenge, add a new character to programâ€™s dictionary.  Have fun!\n'''
